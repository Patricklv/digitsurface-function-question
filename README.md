# digitsurface-function-question

Notes to the files:

1. 'Template_vertices.ply' is the 3D surface mesh of the template file in ascii .ply format. Vertices are included in this file.

2. 'Template_lmclmslm.nts' contains landmarks, curve semilandmarks, and surface semilandmarks digitized using IDAV Landmark Editor and exported as .nts format.

3. 'Sample_vertices.ply' is the 3D surface mesh of the sample file in ascii .ply format. Vertices are included in this file.

4. 'Sample_lmclm.nts' contains landmarks and curve semilandmarks. Suface landmarks are not included in this file since they need to be generated using the digitsurface function in geomorph.

5. 'template.txt' file contains the same coordinate informat as the 'Template_lmclmslm.nts' file but in .txt format. This file should be stored in working directory when using the digitsurface function in geomorph.
